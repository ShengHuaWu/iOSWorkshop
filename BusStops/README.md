## Bus Stops

### Goal

The goal is to write a ‘Swiss bus stops info’ app.
The app should display a listing of all the bus stops in the city (just preselect any Swiss city), including the following information for each stop:
* The name of the bus stop;
* A small map image of the area around the bus stop;
* The estimated time of next departure from the station (For example `in 7 minutes`). It has to be updated dynamically;

So in the end the app will have a list with rows which (each row) contain above information for respective bus stop.
